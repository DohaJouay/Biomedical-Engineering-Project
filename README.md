# Biomedical-Engineering-Project
This project models the flow of air in the pulmonary bronchi in the normal case and also in the case of an asthmatic person.

## Introduction

  Breathing, a physiological process that supplies the body with oxygen and frees it from the dioxide of 
is provided by the respiratory system, which is made up of the nose, pharynx, larynx, bronchi 
and lungs. Each of these organs has a particular function that it plays in the breathing process. 
Asthma is a chronic disease that affects the airways of the lungs, it is an inflammation 
and airway stenosis that prevents airflow. These inflammations vary in intensity and 
frequency from person to person. 
Computer tools play a very important role in the field of biology, as they seek to 
design and simulate mathematical models to understand the different behaviours of 
biological systems and the diseases that can accompany them. 
This project is particularly interested in the flow of air in the pulmonary bronchi, which could be 
modeled by the flow of a fluid in a rigid tube. Hence, Stokes Navier's equation 
is solved for a stationary flow in a cylindrical bronchus, then the same study is performed in a 
bronchus with deformities, i.e. in a person with asthma, the results found are then interpreted and the increase in resistance as a function of the geometry of the bronchus is measured. 

## Documents uploaded

The files uploaded contain all the code realized in Matlab for the study of the bronchi with and without asthma.
